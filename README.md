In this analysis, I have provided my views on attrition at a certain firm, as well as some other personnel statistics, to help the company's management make essential decisions in the future for the benefit of the company and its employees.
During this endeavor, I developed my skills in the following areas:
- Accurate knowledge of the raw data provided 
-Data purification and ETL techniques
- I generated a calculated field.
-Created a dashboard with numerous visuals.
-Learning about the company's overall employees structure
